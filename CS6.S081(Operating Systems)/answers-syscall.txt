1. usertrap() funnction in kernel/trap.c calls syscall()
2. The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7, which represents SYS_exec - the system call number for the exec system call.

3. This code checks that the trap came from user mode.
   The SPP bit says what mode the CPU was in before the trap:
	0 means user mode
	1 means kernel mode

    usertrap() should only run for user-mode traps, so if the bit is not 0, it panics.
    So the CPU was previously in user mode.

4. The line num = p->trapframe->a7; becomes the assembly instruction ld a5,168(s2), which loads the syscall number from the trapframe. The value is then copied into register a3, which is the register used for num.

So the kernel loads num into a5 first, then into a3.

5. The kernel crashes because it attempts to dereference a null pointer (address 0), which is not mapped in the kernel's virtual address space, resulting in a load page fault (scause = 0xd).

6. The binary name: "initcode" (or it might show as "init" if the exec syscall had succeeded)
   The process id (pid) is 1
