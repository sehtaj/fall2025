1. Function arguments are passed using registers a0 to a7. In printf, the value 13 is stored in a1.

2. There is no direct call to f or g. The compiler put their code inside main instead of calling them.

3. The address of printf is the 0x66a in call.asm.

4. ra stores the address of the next instruction after the function call.
   ra = 0x40 because jalr stores PC + 4, and here the jalr instruction is at address 0x3c, so the next instruction is at 0x40.

5. 

6. printf expects two integers (%d %d) but we only give one which is 3.
   So x will print 3 and y will print garbage value
